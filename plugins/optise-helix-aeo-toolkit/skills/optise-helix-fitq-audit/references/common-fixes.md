# 12 Most Common FITq Failure Modes — Template Fixes

**Used by:** `optise-helix-fitq-audit` exclusively.
**Purpose:** When the audit identifies a common failure, the skill outputs the matching template fix, with no inventing new fixes per page. Templates are validated against the Optise EU AEO Playbook, Sections 4-5.

**Template rule (mandatory):** keep the structure of each template, but never output its example values as facts. Every date, price, name, statistic, region, certification, and compliance statement in a template is an illustration. In the output, replace each one with a fact the user stated in this session or a `[User to add: ...]` placeholder. Company names in examples (ExampleCo, Tool A, Tool B, Tool C) are fictional (Plugin Rule 1).

## Contents
- 1. No visible last-updated date
- 2. Page is JS-gated (content not in raw HTML)
- 3. H1 doesn't mirror a real buyer prompt
- 4. No BLUF in the first 100 words
- 5. Wall-of-text body (no tables, lists, FAQs)
- 6. Anonymous author / no byline
- 7. Stats with no source links
- 8. No FAQ schema markup
- 9. Marketing copy at the top, answer below the fold
- 10. Pricing missing from a comparison page
- 11. No "not ideal for" / honesty section
- 12. Bot-blocking via robots.txt or Cloudflare challenge

---

## Failure 1 — No visible last-updated date

**Detection:** `fetch_page.py` returns `last_updated.found = False`
**Trust score impact:** -10 to -15 points
**Effort:** 30 minutes (one-time, then automate via CMS)

**Template fix:**

Add this immediately below the H1:

```html
<p class="last-updated">
  <time datetime="[YYYY-MM-DD]">Last updated: [Month D, YYYY]</time>
</p>
```

For dynamic CMS injection (preferred), use the CMS's "last modified" field and surface it visibly. The date must be:
- Visible to a sighted reader (not in `<meta>` only)
- Inside a `<time datetime="...">` tag for AI engine extraction
- Updated whenever content materially changes (not just on every save)

**Why this matters:** Per the FITq rubric, Trust signal scores ≤15 if there's no date or the date is stale (>90 days). AI engines use freshness as a primary trust filter.

---

## Failure 2 — Page is JS-gated

**Detection:** `fetch_page.py` returns `js_gating.js_gated = True`
**Findability score impact:** Capped at 5/25
**Effort:** 1-4 weeks (engineering work)

**Template fix:**

This is a structural fix, not a content fix. The page must render in raw HTML on first byte. Three options:

1. **Server-side rendering (SSR):** Convert the page from client-side React/Vue to SSR. For Next.js use `getServerSideProps` or app router. For Nuxt use `asyncData`. For React without a framework, deploy via something like Vercel ISR.
2. **Static pre-rendering:** If the content doesn't change per-user, pre-render at build time. Faster than SSR. Most decision pages (alternatives, pricing, trust centre) qualify.
3. **Hybrid:** Render the answer block server-side, hydrate the rest client-side. Lowest engineering effort if the site is mostly client-side already.

**Until this is fixed, no other AEO work matters.** AI engines see almost nothing on a JS-gated page.

---

## Failure 3 — H1 doesn't mirror a real buyer prompt

**Detection:** `fetch_page.py` returns H1 text. The skill compares against the target prompt (if provided) or against the page's URL slug. Generic H1s like "Welcome to [Brand]" or "[Brand] Service Desk" fail this check.
**Intent Match score impact:** -5 to -15 points
**Effort:** 10 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Replace generic H1 with a question-form H1 that mirrors the buyer prompt.

**Before:**
```html
<h1>ExampleCo — IT Service Management</h1>
```

**After:**
```html
<h1>Best service desk software for German Mittelstand IT teams</h1>
```

If the page covers multiple buyer questions, lead with the highest-volume one in the H1 and use H2s for the others.

---

## Failure 4 — No BLUF in the first 100 words

**Detection:** The first 100 words of body text don't contain a direct, self-contained answer to the H1's implicit question.
**Intent Match + Quoteability score impact:** -10 points combined
**Effort:** 30 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Insert a 40-60 word BLUF immediately after the H1, before any marketing copy.

**Before:**
```
[H1] Best service desk software for German Mittelstand IT teams
[Marketing hero copy]
[Subheading]
[More marketing]
[Eventually, the answer 800 words down]
```

**After:**
```
[H1] Best service desk software for German Mittelstand IT teams
[BLUF — 40-60 words] For German Mittelstand IT teams (200-2000 employees), the three best service desk options in 2026 are Tool A (best for [User to add: verified strength]), Tool B (best for [User to add: verified strength]), and Tool C (best for [User to add: verified strength]). [User to add: one verified qualifier sentence.]
[Then the rest of the page]
```

The BLUF must:
- Be 40-60 words (not 30, not 80)
- Answer the H1's implicit question directly
- Name the top 3 options or the single recommendation
- Be self-contained (extractable as a single quote)
- Use the buyer's own framing, not marketing language

→ Hand off to `optise-helix-bluf-writer` for help drafting the actual text.

---

## Failure 5 — Wall-of-text body

**Detection:** `fetch_page.py` reports paragraphs >> headings/tables/lists. Specifically: paragraph count > 30 AND (table count + list count) < 5.
**Quoteability score impact:** -10 to -15 points
**Effort:** 1-2 hours per page

**Template fix:**

Convert paragraph prose to structured answer blocks. Each block:
- Question-style H2 heading
- 1-sentence direct answer
- 2-3 bullet supporting points OR a short table
- Optional 1-sentence proof statement with a source link

**Before:**
```
[800 words of paragraph prose explaining pricing]
```

**After:**
```
## How much does [tool] cost for German Mittelstand?

Pricing starts at €X per agent per month for the Starter plan and scales to €Y for Enterprise.

| Plan | Price (per agent/month) | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Starter | €X | <50 agents |
| Pro | €Y | 50-200 agents |
| Enterprise | €Z | 200+ agents, custom SLAs |

[User to add: billing terms, for example currency, billing period, and volume discounts.]
```

---

## Failure 6 — Anonymous author / no byline

**Detection:** No `<author>`, no schema.org `Person`, no visible "By [Name]" text.
**Trust score impact:** -5 to -10 points
**Effort:** 15 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Add a byline with a real named person and link to a bio:

```html
<p class="byline">
  By <a href="/team/[author-slug]" rel="author">[Author name]</a>,
  [Job title] at [Company]
</p>
```

If no real person is appropriate (e.g., it's a product page), at minimum use:

```html
<p class="byline">By the [Company] Product Team. Last reviewed by <a href="/team/cto">[CTO Name]</a>.</p>
```

**Never use:** "By [Brand] Team" with no link. AI engines treat this as no byline at all.

---

## Failure 7 — Stats with no source links

**Detection:** Page contains numeric claims (e.g., "85% of users", "saves 20 hours/week") without `<a href>` to a source.
**Trust score impact:** -5 to -10 points
**Effort:** 20 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Every quantitative claim must link to its source. Pattern:

**Before:**
```
85% of customers report faster ticket resolution.
```

**After:**
```
85% of customers report faster ticket resolution
(<a href="/research/[survey-page]">[Survey name and year], n=[sample size]</a>).
```

If the source is internal, link to a named methodology page. If the source is external, link to the original (not an aggregator). If the stat has no defensible source, **drop the stat** rather than weaken it with vague attribution.

---

## Failure 8 — No FAQ schema markup

**Detection:** `fetch_page.py` returns `schema_markup` without a `FAQPage` entry, but the page contains 3+ Q&A-style headings.
**Quoteability score impact:** -5 to -10 points
**Effort:** 30 minutes (one-time per page template)

**Template fix:**

**Rule 4 check first (operating-principles.md).** Google no longer shows FAQ rich results for most sites (only well-known government and health sites since August 2023), so a corporate, marketing, compliance, or product page is not eligible. Either use an eligible substitute from Rule 4 (for example `Organization` + `hasCredential` + `WebPage` for a trust centre, or `Product` + `Offer` for pricing), or, if FAQPage is kept for other AI parsers, include the Rule 4 disclosure note in the output.

If FAQPage is kept, add JSON-LD in the `<head>`. Every answer below is a placeholder: output only what the user stated, never these sample sentences as facts.

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is [tool] GDPR compliant?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[User to add: GDPR status exactly as the user states it]. [Tool] acts as [User to add: Data Processor, Data Controller, or both] under EU Regulation 2016/679. [User to add: where the DPA is available, with URL]."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Where is customer data stored?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Customer data is stored in [User to add: exact hosting regions, primary and failover]. [User to add: whether data ever leaves those regions, and under what conditions]."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

The schema must mirror visible page content (don't add Q&A pairs only in the schema; Google's structured data guidelines require markup to match what the page shows).

---

## Failure 9 — Marketing copy at top, answer below the fold

**Detection:** First 100 words of body text contain marketing language ("revolutionary", "leading", "world-class", "transform") but no direct answer to the page's implicit question.
**Intent Match score impact:** -10 to -15 points
**Effort:** 30 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Move the answer above the marketing. The page should answer the buyer's question first, then expand into the brand story (if at all). Marketing language is allowed below the answer block, not before it.

This is the same fix as Failure 4 (BLUF) but applied to pages that have an answer somewhere — just not in the right place.

---

## Failure 10 — Pricing missing from a comparison page

**Detection:** Page is a `/compare/*`, `/alternatives/*`, or `/vs/*` URL but contains no pricing information for the user's product OR for the competitors.
**Intent Match score impact:** -10 points (this is a deal-breaker for AEO citation on pricing prompts)
**Effort:** 30 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Add a pricing comparison table. If you don't disclose your pricing publicly, at minimum show pricing model differences:

```markdown
| Tool | Pricing model | Starting price | Free trial |
|---|---|---|---|
| [You] | [User to add: pricing model] | [User to add: starting price] | [User to add: trial length or "None"] |
| [Competitor 1] | [Verified: pricing model + source] | [Verified: starting price + source] | [Verified: trial + source] |
| [Competitor 2] | [Verified: pricing model + source] | [Verified: starting price, or "Contact sales"] | [Verified: trial + source] |

Competitor prices must come from the competitor's own pricing page, fetched in this session and tagged `[VERIFIED · source]` (Rule 8 and Plugin Rule 1). If a price cannot be verified, write "[User to confirm: ...]" instead of a number.
```

**Why this matters:** Comparison pages without pricing get filtered out of AI engine citation chains. AI engines treat pricing as a structural completeness signal, not just user-relevant info.

---

## Failure 11 — No "not ideal for" section

**Detection:** Page makes only positive claims. No section explicitly stating who shouldn't use the product.
**Trust score impact:** -5 points (and a major RACE failure when that audit runs)
**Effort:** 20 minutes per page

**Template fix:**

Add a "Not ideal for" section near the bottom of decision pages:

```markdown
## Who [tool] is not ideal for

- **[User to add: customer type]:** [User to add: the honest reason, as the user states it]. [User to add: what fits them better, if the user wants to name it].
- **[User to add: customer type]:** [User to add: reason]. [User to add: alternative].

Illustration only (fictional ExampleCo, do not reuse): "**Companies under 20 employees:** ExampleCo's pricing assumes 20+ agents. Smaller teams may find a lighter tool a better fit."
```

Honest constraints are a trust signal. AI engines and procurement teams trust products that admit their limits.

---

## Failure 12 — Bot-blocking via robots.txt or Cloudflare

**Detection:** `fetch_page.py` returns 401, 403 or 429 for its own honest user agent (a possible sign of bot blocking; the script never impersonates AI crawlers, so confirm by reading robots.txt and asking the user), OR robots.txt blocks GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot.
**Findability score impact:** 0/25 — page is invisible
**Effort:** 5 minutes (robots.txt) to a few hours (Cloudflare config)

**Template fix:**

Robots.txt — explicitly allow AI crawlers:
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Allow: /
```

Cloudflare — disable "Block AI Bots" in the dashboard, OR add a Page Rule that whitelists AI crawler UAs. If you're worried about content scraping, use the `nosnippet` meta tag for selective sections instead of blocking entire crawlers.

**Until this is fixed, no other AEO work matters.** Bot-blocking is the most common silent killer of AI citation.
