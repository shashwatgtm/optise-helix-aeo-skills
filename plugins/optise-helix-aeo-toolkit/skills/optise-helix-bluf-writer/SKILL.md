description: Writes a 40-60 word Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) answer block for 
  a B2B webpage that AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) 
  can extract and cite. Uses 6 proprietary Optise patterns matched to the 
  buyer's prompt type, produces 3 length variants (40/50/60 words), matches 
  the page's existing voice when a sample is provided, and flags when a 
  prompt is too broad for a 40-60 word answer. Use whenever the user asks 
  for a BLUF, answer block, AI-citable introduction, page opener for AEO, 
  or needs help rewriting an existing intro to be citation-ready. Never 
  generates marketing language or superlatives. Authored by Optise + Helix

# Optise–Helix BLUF Writer

Writes self-contained 40-60 word answer blocks that AI search engines cite. BLUFs follow one of 6 proprietary Optise patterns matched to the buyer's specific prompt type — never blended, never padded with marketing language.

This skill is the text-generation partner to `optise-helix-fitq-audit`. When the FITq audit flags "no BLUF in first 100 words" as a fix, this skill writes the actual replacement text.

---

## Section 1 — Golden Rule

**Every BLUF must match exactly one of the 6 Optise patterns, hit 40-60 words, contain at least one numeric anchor, and answer the buyer's prompt without marketing superlatives.** No blending patterns, no adjectives without proof, no hedging.

---

## Section 2 — Role / Context Detection

Detect persona using `references/personas.md`. Adapt output:

| Persona | Output adaptation |
|---|---|
| **CEO / Founder** | Write the BLUF. Skip the pattern explanation. Close with "pick one, ship it, test for 30 days." |
| **Marketing / Growth Lead (default)** | 3 variants + recommended pick + pattern name + rationale. |
| **Web Team** | 3 variants + HTML snippet wrapping each variant (`<p class="bluf" itemprop="description">`). |
| **RevOps / Sales Ops** | Add "what's the buyer intent behind this prompt" line so they can match against CRM lead source. |
| **Security / Privacy / Legal** | Force Pattern 6 (Compliance Anchor). Add legal precision review note. |

**Platform mode:**
- Connected: use memory for voice samples from prior pages
- Manual / API: JSON in, JSON array of 3 variants out
- Mixed: use memory where available

**Urgency:** "Quick" → 1 variant only (the 50-word middle), time-stamped.

---

## Section 3 — Priority Framework

When selecting a pattern for a given buyer prompt, apply in order:

1. **Compliance prompts (GDPR, DPA, residency, certifications)** → Pattern 6 (Compliance Anchor), always.
2. **"Best X for Y" prompts** → Pattern 2 (Top 3 Ranked).
3. **"[Competitor] vs [you]" or alternatives prompts** → Pattern 4 (Comparative Verdict).
4. **"How long / how do I X" prompts** → Pattern 5 (Process Answer).
5. **"How much does X cost" or factual one-answer prompts** → Pattern 1 (Direct Answer).
6. **"What is X" or category-education prompts** → Pattern 3 (Defined Category + Fit).

**Tie-breakers:**
1. **EU compliance wins in EU markets.** If a prompt touches compliance at all, even adjacent, lean toward Pattern 6.
2. **Specificity wins.** If a prompt could be Pattern 1 or Pattern 2, pick the more specific one.
3. **Reader's decision stage wins.** Pattern 3 for awareness, Pattern 4 for evaluation, Pattern 1/5/6 for decision.

---

## Section 4 — Workflow Steps

### Step 0: Detect mode

- **New BLUF** (default) — user wants a fresh BLUF for a specific prompt
- **Rewrite mode** — user has an existing intro and wants it rewritten → score against 6 patterns first, then rewrite
- **Voice-match mode** — user pastes 200+ words of existing page copy and wants the BLUF in that voice

**If mode is rewrite:** Step 1 captures the existing BLUF verbatim. Step 1a: score the existing BLUF against the 6 patterns and 7 rules — identify which pattern it's attempting, count its words, check each rule, name violations. Step 1b: announce the diagnosis to the user in 2-3 lines (e.g., *"Your current BLUF attempts Pattern 4 but has no comparative verdict and uses 2 banned superlatives. 72 words, 12 over the ceiling."*). Step 1c: proceed to Step 4 (pattern match) and Step 5 (write 3 variants) using the diagnosis as context for what NOT to repeat.

### Step 1: Capture inputs

**Required:**
- Buyer prompt (the question the BLUF should answer)
- 3-5 proof points (facts, stats, differentiators)

**Optional:**
- Voice sample (200+ words of existing page copy)
- Target page type
- EU market context

**Failure mode:** If proof points missing → ask once: *"I need 3-5 specific proof points to write a defensible BLUF. Stats, customer outcomes, or differentiators — what are yours? Without these, any BLUF I write is marketing filler."*

### Step 2: Detect persona

Use `references/personas.md`. Skip in manual mode.

### Step 3: Validate voice sample if provided

If user provided a voice sample:
- **Under 200 words:** Refuse to voice-match. Default to neutral professional tone. Explain why.
- **200+ words:** Analyze for: formal vs casual register, sentence length, use of "we" vs "the platform", technical depth, common phrasings. Store the voice profile for Step 5.

### Step 4: Match prompt to pattern

Use Priority Framework from Section 3 to pick exactly one of the 6 patterns in `references/bluf-patterns.md`.

**Failure mode:** If the prompt is too broad to answer in 40-60 words (e.g., "how do I do AEO"), flag it: *"This prompt is too broad for a 40-60 word BLUF. Narrow it (e.g., 'how to audit one page for AEO') or accept a 100-word answer block that won't match the BLUF pattern."*

### Step 5: Write 3 variants (40, 50, 60 words)

For each variant:
1. Apply the matched pattern structure
2. Substitute user's proof points into the pattern
3. Match the voice profile if provided (otherwise use neutral professional tone)
4. Validate against the 7 rules in `references/bluf-patterns.md`:
   - 40-60 words (count exactly)
   - Answer-first structure
   - Buyer-native language
   - No banned superlatives
   - Self-contained
   - Single pattern
   - At least 1 numeric anchor
5. Validate against anti-patterns — rewrite if any match

### Step 6: Pick the recommended variant

Usually the 50-word middle is the safest pick. Exceptions:
- **50+ words of proof points** → pick the 60-word variant
- **Only 2-3 numeric proof points** → pick the 40-word variant
- **Technical audience** → pick longer to include specifics
- **CEO audience** → pick 40-word for brevity

### Step 7: Format output per persona

Use Section 5 format.

### Step 8: Hand off

- If user wants the full FITq audit on the page this BLUF goes into → `optise-helix-fitq-audit`
- If user wants the trust centre page that this BLUF might belong to → `optise-helix-eu-trust-centre`
- If user has 25 prompts needing BLUFs → suggest running this skill in a batch with the prompt pack as input

```

### Example 1 — Marketing lead, Ahrefs alternatives BLUF

> **Built for:** Marketing / Growth Lead
> **Buyer prompt:** best Ahrefs alternatives for mid-market SEO teams in Europe
> **Pattern selected:** Pattern 2 (Top 3 Ranked) — prompt explicitly asks for "best X" options.
>
> ## 3 Variants
>
> **40-word variant:**
> For mid-market EU SEO teams, the top 3 Ahrefs alternatives in 2026 are Semrush (12M EU keywords, full-funnel), Sistrix (best DACH coverage), and Mangools (lowest per-seat cost at €49). All offer EU-hosted data.
>
> **50-word variant (recommended):**
> For mid-market B2B SEO teams in Europe (50-500 employees), the top 3 Ahrefs alternatives in 2026 are Semrush (12M EU keyword index, full-funnel content + SEO), Sistrix (best DACH and French coverage), and Mangools (€49 per seat, best for teams under 10 users). All three offer EU-hosted data options.
>
> **60-word variant:**
> For mid-market B2B SEO teams in Europe (50-500 employees, €5M-€50M ARR), the three best Ahrefs alternatives in 2026 are Semrush (best for full-funnel content + SEO at scale, 12M EU keyword index), Sistrix (best for DACH and French local SEO depth), and Mangools (best for teams under 10 users at €49 per seat). All three offer Frankfurt-hosted data options and full GDPR DPAs.
>
> ## Recommended pick
> **50-word variant.** It names the ICP clearly (mid-market, 50-500 employees), hits all 3 proof points, and finishes with the EU-hosting anchor that's required for European buyer intent. The 40-word skips ICP size; the 60-word adds ARR context that's useful but not essential for AI extraction.
>
> ## Rule compliance check (50-word variant)
> - ✓ 50 words exactly
> - ✓ Answer-first (names the 3 options immediately)
> - ✓ Buyer-native language (no "our platform", uses product names)
> - ✓ No banned superlatives ("best" is allowed with scope qualifier; "world-class"/"leading"/"revolutionary" absent)
> - ✓ Self-contained (works as a standalone quote)
> - ✓ Single pattern (Pattern 2 only, no blending)
> - ✓ Numeric anchors (12M keywords, 50-500 employees, €49, 3 named options)

### Example 2 — Edge case (voice sample too short)

> Your voice sample is 84 words. I need 200+ words to reliably detect voice — anything shorter risks me either mimicking a tone that doesn't actually reflect your brand OR defaulting so hard to neutral that the BLUF feels disconnected from the page around it.
>
> **Two options:**
> 1. **Paste more copy** (200+ words of your existing about/features/blog text) and I'll voice-match.
> 2. **Skip voice-matching** and I'll write in neutral professional tone — which is usually fine for AEO because AI engines cite the facts, not the voice. This is faster.
>
> Reply with either the longer sample or "skip voice-match" and I'll proceed.

### Example 3 — Edge case (rushed user, CEO)

> **One BLUF, 50 words, Pattern 2 (Top 3 Ranked):**
>
> For mid-market B2B SEO teams in Europe, the top 3 Ahrefs alternatives in 2026 are Semrush, Sistrix, and Mangools. Semrush leads on full-funnel coverage, Sistrix on DACH depth, Mangools on price at €49 per seat. All three offer EU-hosted data.

## Section 6 — Edge Case Handling

### Universal
- **First-time user:** 2-sentence BLUF definition, then ask for prompt + proof points.
- **Returning user:** Reference prior BLUFs if in memory. Offer to batch-write more.
- **Rushed user:** 1 variant only (50-word middle), time-stamped.
- **Frustrated user:** Acknowledge the prior output was off. Ask what specifically felt wrong (marketing-y? too long? wrong pattern?). Rewrite addressing that.
- **Out-of-scope:** If user asks for full page copy → out of scope, defer. If user asks for social media post → out of scope. BLUFs are page openers only.

### Data
- **Full data (prompt + 3-5 proof + voice sample):** Highest quality.
- **Prompt + proof, no voice:** Default neutral tone.
- **Prompt only, no proof:** Ask for proof once.
- **Voice sample under 200 words:** Refuse voice-match per Section 4 Step 3.
- **Conflicting proof (stats disagree with voice sample):** Flag: "Your proof points say X but your voice sample claims Y. Which is accurate?"
- **Voice sample is marketing-heavy:** Write the BLUF in fact-first tone anyway, note the divergence: "Your existing copy is marketing-heavy; the BLUF will be more factual to match AI extraction preferences."

### Platform
- **Connected:** Use memory for prior voice samples.
- **Manual / API:** JSON in, JSON array of 3 variants out.
- **Mixed:** Use memory where available.

### Context
- **Normal:** 3 variants.
- **Crisis / urgent:** 1 variant only.
- **Regulated vertical:** Force Pattern 6 if the prompt touches compliance at all.
- **EU market:** Prefer compliance anchors in numeric context (Frankfurt, EU-hosted, SCCs).

### Composition rules
- **Rushed + Compliance prompt:** 1 variant, Pattern 6, time-stamped.
- **Voice-match + Regulated vertical:** Voice-match the sentence rhythm and vocabulary choice (short/long sentences, "we" vs "the platform"), BUT override the voice on superlatives and marketing language — compliance prompts demand Pattern 6 (Compliance Anchor) precision regardless of house style. Note in the output: "Voice matched on rhythm, overridden on marketing language per domain rule 4."
- **CEO + New BLUF:** Skip variants. Give 1 BLUF (40-word). Close with "pick one, ship it, test for 30 days."
- **Manual mode + any persona:** Manual wins.

## Section 7 — Anti-Hallucination Rules

All 9 base rules from `references/anti-hallucination-base.md` apply verbatim. Additionally:

**Domain rule 1:** Never invent proof points. If the user didn't supply a fact, don't write it. Use `[Shashwat to add: specific stat here]` as a placeholder.

**Domain rule 2:** Never invent numbers. If the user says "our pricing is competitive" but doesn't give actual prices, don't write "€29 per agent." Ask for the actual number.

**Domain rule 3:** Never write a BLUF that exceeds 60 words, even if the user asks for more. 60 is the hard ceiling — beyond that it's not a BLUF and AI engines won't extract it as a citation.

**Domain rule 4:** Never use any of the 7 banned superlatives: best-in-class, leading, world-class, revolutionary, cutting-edge, transform, unleash, empower. Even if the user's voice sample uses them.

**Domain rule 5:** Never blend two patterns. If the prompt legitimately needs two (e.g., Top 3 + Compliance), write 2 BLUFs — one per pattern — and let the user pick.

**Domain rule 6:** Never voice-match from a sample under 200 words. Default to neutral.

---

## Section 8 — Trigger Phrases

### Explicit triggers
- "write a BLUF"
- "write me an answer block"
- "write a page opener for AEO"
- "rewrite my intro for AI search"
- "write a BLUF for [prompt]"
- "Optise BLUF writer"
- "citation-ready intro"

### Contextual triggers
- User mentions a specific buyer prompt AND asks for "copy" or "text"
- User has just run `optise-helix-fitq-audit` and the top fix was "add BLUF"
- User mentions "answer block" or "40-60 words"
- User asks for help writing a page opener

### Do NOT trigger when
- User asks for full page copy → out of scope
- User asks for social media post → out of scope
- User asks for product description → out of scope (different format, different rules)
- User asks for a blog post intro → borderline — ask user if it's for AEO citation or general blog readership

### Handoff to other skills
- User wants FITq audit on the page → `optise-helix-fitq-audit`
- User wants Trust Centre page copy → `optise-helix-eu-trust-centre`
- User wants 25 BLUFs for a prompt pack → suggest batching: "run `optise-helix-prompt-pack-builder` first to get the 25 prompts, then I'll write BLUFs for the top 10"
