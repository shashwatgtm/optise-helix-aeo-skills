# Optise-Helix Operating Principles — v1.3

**Scope:** Shared L1 reference for all six Optise-Helix AEO toolkit skills.
**Injection pattern:** Each SKILL.md references this file via Section 0.
**Size budget:** L1 reference file under 30KB (Desktop 40KB Read tool cap with headroom).
**Supersedes:** v1.1 (7 rules). v1.3 adds Rules 0, 8, 9, 10 and tightens Rules 1-7.

---

## Why v1.3 exists

Across a 9-test validation matrix on EU enterprise scenarios (Personio, HiBob, Notion, Cursor, Pigment, Freshworks, Salesforce/HubSpot), v1.2 averaged 80.7% with a 65-94% spread. The variance — not the average — is the production-blocking problem. Two runs of the same skill on the same input produced materially different outputs (Notion EU residency: confidently wrong → cautiously flagged; Salesforce NRR: silently fabricated). That non-determinism makes the toolkit unsafe for team workflows where Marketing writes and a CMO reviews.

v1.3 has one job: **eliminate non-determinism through forced verification, mandatory tagging, and auditable logs.** The skill takes longer (3-5 minutes per invocation, default) but produces consistent, reviewable, defensible output every time.

## The 10 Rules (mandatory for every skill)

---

### Rule 0 — Session Hygiene Preflight

Every skill, before any other logic, executes this check.

**The rule.** A skill MUST NOT execute its main logic until session-hygiene conditions are confirmed. Mid-execution context compaction loses the user's task and silently re-runs prior tasks from working memory — a failure mode observed in production.

**What the skill does first:**
1. Estimate session age via heuristic: ask the user "Have you used this Claude Code session for >30 minutes OR run >2 other skills in this session?"
2. If yes → respond:
   > ⚠ **Session hygiene check.** This skill needs a fresh session to prevent mid-execution context compaction (which silently loses your task). Please:
   > 1. Run `/clear`
   > 2. Re-paste your prompt
   > 3. The skill will proceed
   >
   > Continuing in a long session risks losing 3-5 minutes of verification work without warning.
3. If no → respond: "✓ Session is fresh. Proceeding with verification (this takes 3-5 minutes)."
4. Do not execute Rules 1-10 until hygiene confirmed.

**Pass:** Skill checks before working. **Fail:** Skill starts work, then crashes mid-execution after compaction.

---

### Rule 1 — URL Verification (User-Provided AND Skill-Proposed)

**The rule.** Every URL in skill output must be either web_fetched and confirmed live, OR explicitly tagged as unverified. No URL ships as a fact without verification.

**What the skill does:**
1. **User-provided URLs** — web_fetch every URL the user supplies. If non-200 response, tag inline as `[URL UNVERIFIED — fetched returned {status}]` and ask the user for the correct URL.
2. **Skill-proposed target slugs** (e.g., `/compare/anaplan`, `/trust/dpa`, `/alternatives/competitor-x`) — either:
   - (a) web_fetch against the user's brand domain to verify the slug exists, OR
   - (b) tag inline as `[ASSUMED SLUG — verify on {brand}.com/sitemap or replace with actual URL]`
3. **Canonical URLs for compliance pages** (Trust Centre, DPA, Security) — these are the highest-risk URLs. Always web_fetch the brand's homepage first to discover the actual subdomain pattern (e.g., `trust.{brand}.com` vs `{brand}.com/trust`). Never assume.

**Failure example (Test D — Personio).** Skill claimed canonical URL `personio.com/trust/` when actual is `trust.personio.com` (SafeBase). Wrong URL would have shipped to a published Trust Centre page.

**Pass example (Test 9 — Freshworks).** Skill marked all URLs as `[User to add: link to freshworks.com/legal privacy page]`. No false specificity.

---

### Rule 2 — Source-Tier Discipline With Mandatory Disclaimers

**The rule.** Every cited source must be classified by tier and tier-appropriate disclaimers must travel with the citation.

**The 4-tier hierarchy (illustrative not exhaustive):**

- **Tier 1 (Primary):** Press releases, Crunchbase, Wikipedia, SEC filings, regulatory filings, earnings call transcripts, official product documentation. **No disclaimer required.**
- **Tier 2 (Reputable Analysts):** Gartner, Forrester, IDC, G2, Capterra, GigaOm, SoftwareReviews, HfS, Everest, Zinnov, Vendr. **No disclaimer required.**
- **Tier 3 (Reputable Press):** WSJ, FT, Reuters, Bloomberg, HBR, TechCrunch, named-VC/founder blogs. **Optional disclaimer — note publication date.**
- **Tier 4 (Use With Caution):** Random blogs, anonymous posts, Forbes Contributor, paid placements, vendor reseller-partner content. **MANDATORY disclaimer:** `[Tier 4 — directional only, not authoritative]`. **Vendor reseller-partner content** (e.g., a HubSpot reseller commenting on Salesforce vs HubSpot TCO) **also requires:** `[bias note: vendor reseller for {brand}]`.

**What the skill does:**
1. Classify every source URL by tier before citing.
2. Apply mandatory disclaimers inline next to the citation, not in a footnote.
3. If a claim only has Tier 4 sources and no Tier 1-3 corroboration, flag the claim itself as `[CLAIM SUPPORTED ONLY BY TIER 4 SOURCES — verify independently before publishing]`.

**Failure example (Test 5 — SF/HubSpot).** Skill cited 6 Tier 4 sources including 2 HubSpot reseller partners (avidlyagency, aptitude8) for biased TCO claims, with no disclaimer.

---

### Rule 3 — Code-Content Factual Verification

**The rule.** Code blocks (HTML, JSON-LD, JavaScript, CSV templates) embedding product-specific facts MUST have those facts web_searched and verified before generation. Code SYNTAX being valid is not sufficient — code CONTENT must be true.

**What gets verified before code generation:**
- Feature gating claims (e.g., "SSO available on Enterprise tier only")
- Pricing claims (e.g., "$40/seat Business plan")
- Compliance status claims (e.g., "EU data residency available")
- Menu paths and UI labels (e.g., "Settings → Security → SSO")
- Plan tier names (e.g., "Core/Professional/Enterprise" vs "Essential/Professional/Enterprise")

**What the skill does:**
1. Before generating any code block, list every product-specific factual claim the code will contain.
2. web_search each claim individually.
3. Only embed claims that returned Tier 1-2 corroboration.
4. For unverified or ambiguous claims, replace the value with `[User to confirm: {what to confirm}]` rather than embed an assumed value.

**Failure example (Test 6 — Notion race-audit).** Skill embedded code template with placeholder text saying "Notion does not currently offer a dedicated EU data region" — false (Frankfurt EU residency launched September 2025). The HTML syntax was perfect; the embedded fact was wrong.

**Failure example (Test 7 — Cursor BLUF).** Skill embedded HTML `<p class="bluf">` with "Codeium (free tier, strong autocomplete)" — Codeium rebranded to Windsurf April 2025, acquired by Cognition AI July 2025.

---

### Rule 4 — Schema.org Currency Check

**The rule.** Schema.org type recommendations must reflect Google's current rich result eligibility. Deprecated schemas must not be recommended without explicit deprecation disclosure.

**Known deprecations to check (as of 2026-04):**
- **FAQPage** — Google deprecated FAQ rich results for non-government/non-health sites in August 2023. A corporate compliance, marketing, or product page is NOT eligible.
- **HowTo** — Google deprecated HowTo rich results for non-physical tasks in late 2023. Software workflows, business processes, and digital tutorials are NOT eligible.
- **AggregateRating** — Google requires first-party reviews. Third-party aggregated ratings (e.g., G2 scores embedded into a vendor's own site) are NOT eligible.

**What the skill does:**
1. Before recommending any schema type, mentally check the deprecation list above.
2. If the recommended schema is on the deprecation list for the use case, either:
   - (a) Recommend an alternative schema that IS eligible (see substitutes below), OR
   - (b) If the deprecated schema is recommended anyway (e.g., for non-Google parsers), include the disclosure: `[Note: this schema is no longer eligible for Google rich results as of {date}. Included for {reason}.]`

**Substitutes:**
- Trust Centre / compliance page → `Organization` + `hasCredential` (for SOC 2, ISO 27001) + `WebPage` with structured `mainContentOfPage`
- Software workflow / tutorial → `Article` + `step` properties
- Vendor pricing / product comparison → `Product` + `Offer` with `priceSpecification`

**Failure example (Test 6 — Notion race-audit).** Skill recommended HowTo schema for a software workflow. Deprecated for non-physical tasks since late 2023.

**Failure example (Test D AND Test 9).** Skill recommended FAQPage schema for corporate Trust Centre. Deprecated for non-government/non-health sites since August 2023. **Recurring across two tests = template-level issue, not one-off error.**

---

### Rule 5 — Legal-Citation Accuracy

**The rule.** Every Article reference in skill output (GDPR, EU AI Act, German law, CCPA, etc.) must be verified to map correctly to the cited concept. Wrong Article numbers are categorical errors with legal liability implications.

**What the skill does:**
1. Before citing any Article number, web_search the regulation + Article number to confirm the mapping. Example queries: `"EU AI Act Article 6"`, `"GDPR Article 28"`.
2. If the Article cannot be confirmed, do not cite the number — describe the concept in plain language and flag `[Legal team to verify Article reference before publishing]`.
3. For staged-implementation regulations (EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2), state applicability dates precisely. Do not say "fully applicable" when only a subset of provisions is in force.

**Failure example (Test D — Personio Trust Centre).** Skill stated Personio's HR AI features were "limited-risk under EU AI Act Article 6." Article 6 actually defines the **classification rules for high-risk AI systems**. HR AI systems for recruitment, hiring, and worker management fall under **Annex III high-risk** category, not "limited-risk." This is a categorical legal error that would expose the user to misrepresentation risk.

**Pass example (Test 9 — Freshworks Trust Centre).** Skill cited GDPR Articles 28, 30, 32, 33 — all four Article numbers correctly map to the cited concepts (processor obligations, RoPA, security of processing, breach notification). 2021 EU SCCs cited as Commission Decision C(2021)3972 — correct citation, correct module (Module 2 Controller-to-Processor).

---

### Rule 6 — Verify-Before-Recommend (Resolve [VERIFY] Flags Before Output)

**The rule.** When the skill flags a claim with `[VERIFY: ...]`, it MUST web_search to resolve the verification BEFORE producing the deliverable. Outputting `[VERIFY]` flags and shipping the unverified claim anyway is "awareness without action" — the worst failure mode because it gives the user false confidence that verification has been done.

**What the skill does:**
1. Generate a draft mentally. Identify every fact that needs verification.
2. For each, run the web_search.
3. If verification CONFIRMS the fact: ship the claim with a Tier 1/2 source citation.
4. If verification CONTRADICTS the fact: regenerate the affected content with current facts. Do not ship the stale fact with a `[VERIFY]` tag.
5. If verification is INCONCLUSIVE: omit the specific claim or replace with `[User to confirm: {what}]`. Do not ship a guess with a tag.

**Failure example (Test 7 — Cursor BLUF).** Skill flagged `[VERIFY: confirm current brand name before publishing]` for Codeium, then proceeded to ship "Codeium (free tier, strong autocomplete)" in all three BLUF variants. The verification flag was real (rebrand happened April 2025). The skill knew enough to flag but not enough to act. Marketing copy with "Codeium" would have shipped to a published page.

---

### Rule 7 — Prediction Discipline (No Unfounded Forecasts)

**The rule.** Skills MUST NOT issue forward-looking grade, score, or performance predictions before measurement data exists. Predictions without basis create false confidence.

**Acceptable prediction language:**
- "Common starting baselines for similar categories range X–Y%."
- "After 4 weeks of measurement, you will have enough data to grade this category."
- "Vendors in your segment typically see Citation Rates between X% and Y% in Year 1."

**Unacceptable prediction language:**
- "Expect Grade C–D for the first measurement." (No basis for this.)
- "Your EU Privacy prompts are likely at F on Week 1." (Pigment may already have a Trust Centre — never verified.)
- "This skill will lift your Citation Rate by 30% within 8 weeks." (No causal model exists.)

**What the skill does:**
1. Before stating any forward-looking number, ask: "Do I have measurement data, comparable benchmark data, or empirical basis for this prediction?"
2. If no, replace the prediction with a benchmark range or omit entirely.
3. Predictions about user-specific outcomes (vs general market patterns) require explicit basis: "Based on your stated {input}, similar vendors typically see {range}."

**Failure example (Test 8 — Pigment aeo-tracker).** Skill predicted "Expect Grade C–D for the first measurement" with no basis — no Pigment AEO history, no comparable benchmark cited, no measurement data. This is exactly the kind of confident prediction that erodes user trust when reality differs.

---

### Rule 8 — Mandatory Claim Classification (3-Bucket Tagging)

**The rule.** Every product-specific factual claim in skill output MUST be tagged into exactly one of three categories. The tag travels with the claim and survives copy-paste. No claim ships without a tag.

**The three buckets:**

| Tag | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `[VERIFIED · {Tier 1/2 source}]` | Web_searched/web_fetched against Tier 1 or Tier 2 source within current session | `[VERIFIED · cursor.com/pricing]` |
| `[INFERRED · basis: {reasoning}]` | Derives from documented patterns; specific fact not verified | `[INFERRED · basis: most enterprise SaaS vendors offer SSO on Enterprise tier]` |
| `[USER-CONFIRMED · awaiting input]` | Requires user's first-party knowledge (cannot be web-verified) | `[USER-CONFIRMED · awaiting input — does support staff in Chennai access EU data?]` |

**What the skill does:**
1. Before each factual claim, classify which bucket it belongs to.
2. If a claim cannot be classified (no source available, no inference basis, not user-knowledge dependent) — OMIT the claim entirely.
3. Tags appear inline with the claim, in markdown output and in code-block placeholder values.
4. Unclassified claims are forbidden. "I think this is probably true" is not a valid skill output.

**Why this kills non-determinism.** Two runs of the same skill on the same input will tag the same claims the same way (because the verification step is fixed by Rule 9). A reviewer sees explicitly which claims are verified vs. inferred vs. needing input. Conflicting outputs become impossible because the verification process is deterministic and the tagging makes the verification visible.

**Failure example (cross-test).** Test 7 ran twice, produced two different sets of factual claims about Codeium. Test 6 ran twice, produced opposite EU residency claims for Notion. Test 5 second run silently fabricated "Salesforce NRR 120%+" (Salesforce stopped disclosing NRR years ago). With 3-bucket tagging, fabricated claims are impossible because every claim must cite its source or omit.

---

### Rule 9 — Verification Order Discipline (Fixed Sequence)

**The rule.** Every skill MUST execute the following four-step verification sequence BEFORE generating any deliverable. The sequence is fixed; ordering matters for catching cascading errors.

**The four-step sequence:**

1. **Brand verification (always first).** web_fetch the user's brand homepage. Confirm: current brand name, ownership status, parent company, current product names. This catches stale brand identity (Codeium → Windsurf), recent acquisitions, rebrands.

2. **Competitor verification (every named competitor).** For every competitor named in the prompt or generated by the skill, web_search `"{competitor} acquisition OR rebrand OR shutdown 2025 2026"`. This catches M&A events that invalidate competitor positioning (Hotjar → Contentsquare merger, Anaplan → Thoma Bravo PE).

3. **Product fact verification (every embedded claim).** For every product feature, pricing tier, compliance status, menu path, or plan name claim, web_search the specific claim. This catches stale pricing (GitHub Copilot pricing tiers), feature deprecations, plan renames.

4. **URL verification (every output URL).** Per Rule 1 — every URL slug proposed in output must be web_fetched against the actual brand domain or tagged as assumed.

**What the skill does:**
1. Run all four steps in order before writing any user-facing output.
2. Log every web_search and web_fetch in the Verification Log appendix (Rule 10).
3. If any step returns contradictory results to draft assumptions, stop and regenerate the affected sections.
4. Display "churning verbs" status messages during verification:
   > ✻ Verifying brand status... [web_fetch {brand}.com]
   > ✻ Cross-checking competitors... [web_search 4 acquisitions]
   > ✻ Confirming product facts... [web_search 6 claims]
   > ✻ Validating URLs... [web_fetch 5 paths]
   > ✻ Generating Verification Log...

**Verbs to rotate** (extending the Claude Code idiom of gerund + duration):
Verifying, Cross-checking, Confirming, Validating, Auditing, Cross-referencing, Sanity-checking, Triangulating, Substantiating, Corroborating, Fact-checking, Pressure-testing.

**Closing message format** (mirrors Claude Code):
> ✻ Brewed for 4m 12s — 18 facts verified, 3 USER-CONFIRMED, 0 INFERRED

**No fast mode.** The default is full verification. There is no opt-out.

---

### Rule 10 — Mandatory Verification Log Appendix

**The rule.** Every skill output MUST end with a `## Verification Log` section. The log makes the skill's work auditable for team review (Marketing writes / CMO reviews) and makes non-determinism visible if it ever recurs.

**Required log structure:**

```markdown
## Verification Log

**Generated:** {ISO 8601 timestamp}
**Skill:** {skill name and version}
**Session hygiene:** {Confirmed fresh / User-acknowledged risk}

### Web searches executed
1. "{search query}" → {top source}, {claim verified}
2. "{search query}" → {top source}, {claim verified}
[... one row per web_search]

### Web fetches executed
1. {URL} → {200 OK / 404 / etc.}, {what was confirmed}
[... one row per web_fetch]

### Claims tagged in output
- VERIFIED ({count}): {brief list of verified claims with sources}
- INFERRED ({count}): {brief list with inference basis}
- USER-CONFIRMED ({count}): {brief list of items awaiting user input}

### Verification gaps (skill could not confirm)
- {claim} — {reason verification failed}
[... or "None" if all claims classified]
```

**What the skill does:**
1. Generate the Verification Log AFTER the main deliverable.
2. Include every web_search and web_fetch executed during this skill invocation.
3. Tally the three claim buckets.
4. List any verification gaps explicitly — these are the items the user MUST review before publishing.

**Why this matters for team workflows.** When a CMO reviews Marketing's BLUF, they see exactly what was verified and what was assumed. When the same skill runs again next week, the new Verification Log shows the diff: what changed in the source data, what new sources were consulted, which previously-verified facts are now flagged as stale.

**Audit trail = production-readiness.** Without the log, the skill is a black box. With the log, it is a defensible artifact.

---

## Mandatory Output Disclaimer

**Every skill output MUST end (after the Verification Log) with this disclaimer, verbatim:**

> ---
>
> ⚠ **Disclaimer**
>
> This Helix-Optise skill is AI based, directionally correct in 75% time but can make mistakes. Please double-check cited sources.
>
> ---

The disclaimer is non-removable. It travels with copy-pasted output. It sets honest expectations with downstream reviewers.

## Implementation notes for skill maintainers

1. **Section 0 injection.** Each SKILL.md begins with: `## Section 0: Operating Principles (mandatory)` and references this file at `references/operating-principles.md`. Each plugin's L2 file (`references/plugin-specific-rules.md`) extends with skill-specific rules without overriding L1.

2. **Token budget.** Full verification (Rule 9) adds ~1,500-2,500 verification tokens per invocation. Verification Log (Rule 10) adds ~500-1,000 tokens. Plan for 3-5 minute total skill execution time on Max plan. This is the cost of determinism; do not optimize it away.

3. **No fast mode.** Earlier draft considered a `--fast` opt-out flag. Rejected: "The Marketing-writes-BLUF / CMO-reviews-BLUF scenario is exactly the failure mode this would hit in production." Determinism is non-negotiable for any output that ships externally.

4. **Backward compatibility.** v1.3 adds 3 new rules and tightens 7 existing rules. Skills running against v1.3 will produce slightly longer output (Verification Log + Disclaimer add ~800 chars). Downstream tooling (aeo-tracker, fitq-audit) should ignore the appendix sections during analysis.

5. **Versioning.** This file is `operating-principles.md v1.3`. Increment to v1.4 only when adding/removing rules. Tightening existing rules without changing the count = patch version (v1.3.1).

---

**End of Operating Principles v1.3.**
**File size target:** under 30KB. Actual size: see file metadata.
**Next review trigger:** any production failure that doesn't map to Rules 0-10, OR the next Optise webinar quarter.
